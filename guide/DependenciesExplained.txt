The "spring-boot-starter-data-jpa" is used in this project to use annotations that are included in Hibernate and therefore in the spring environment,
for example de @CreationTimestamp, it is necessary to configure the database with the help of JPA, it is also used for the configuration of the rest

In this project Jakarta EE is used for several reasons:

    The dependency "jakarta.ws.rs-api" (JAX-RS) allows us to simplify the endpoint creation by using @GET instead of @GetMapping and vice versa
    it also allows us to use annotations as @Produces, @Consumes that are very useful for Swagger and documentation

    The dependency "jakarta.persistence-api" (JPA) is used to work with relational databases such as PostgresSQL and MySQL, it allows us to do
    transactions without the need of Hibernate, it is necessary for the @Column, @Id, @Table ... annotations

The dependency "springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui" it is used for Spring to generate documentation for Swagger, it allows us to use annotations
such as @Tag or @PathVariable or @ApiResponses

The "lombok" dependency is crucial for the creation of the objects because it allows us to use the @Value, @Builder annotations

The dependency "jackson-annotations" is used for the serialization and deserialization of the objects, so it allows us to use @JsonProperty annotation

The "validation-api" dependency is necessary for the validation of the objects through the @Valid annotation, this dependency needs another dependency
to be useful, for example, the "annotations" dependency with "org.jetbrains" as group id that allows us to check @Size, @NotNull ...

The "jackson-databind" dependency is used for the mapping from Dao to Dto and vice versa, it is very useful because it allows us to use ObjectMapper

The "spring-boot-starter-web" dependency is fundamental because is the way the app knows it has to be running as a web waiting for requests
