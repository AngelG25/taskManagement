In this project Jakarta EE is used for several reasons:

    The dependency "jakarta.ws.rs-api" (JAX-RS) allows us to simplify the endpoint creation by using @GET instead of @GetMapping and vice versa
    it also allows us to use annotations as @Produces, @Consumes that are very useful for Swagger and documentation

    The dependency "jakarta.persistence-api" (JPA) is used to work with relational databases such as PostgresSQL and MySQL, it allows us to do
    transactions without the need of Hibernate

The dependency "springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui" it is used for Spring to generate documentation for Swagger, it allows us to use annotations
such as @Tag or @PathVariable or @ApiResponses
